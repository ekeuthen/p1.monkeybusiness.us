		    	<p>I'm psyched to learn more about web development with this class.  After avoiding anything computer-related for most of my life, I feel lucky to have the opportunity to remedy this while working at Harvard.  At work I think a lot about how to design, test, and document systems so I'm eager to gain insight into the development process.</p>
